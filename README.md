  e.preventDefault();

  const select = document.querySelector('#select-hospital');
  const value = select.value;

  //removing previously displayed data

# Change Log
I originally wanted to create a second display based on the categories instead to the hospitals , but my squad leader advises me to take this part to the PMVP, I agreed. Unfortunately, as the time was passing, I opted to polish the design and to add some animation instead of doing that part. I didnâ€™t have enough time to tweak my CSS and make the page responsive as well.
