        <h1>Welcome to the NYC-HHC Patient Satisfaction Survey App</h1>
        <p>
          This page consists in an app that displays the results of a survey, realized in 2009, on the hospitals
          that are part of the <a href="https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/" target="_blank">New York City Health +
            Hospitals Corporation</a>. It is built around the API survey found on
          <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/NYC-Health-Hospitals-patient-satisfaction-scores-2/hi3x-y76v"
            target="_blank">NYC

        <h3>NYC Public Hospitals Overview</h3>

        <p class="p-hospital"> NYC Health + Hospitals, officially the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation
          (HHC), operates the
          public hospitals and clinics in New York City as a public benefit corporation. As of 2012, HHC is the largest
          municipal healthcare system in the United States with $6.7 billion in annual revenues, serving 1.4 million
          patients, including more than 475,000 uninsured city residents, providing services interpreted in more than
          190 languages. HHC was created in 1969 by the New York State Legislature as a public benefit corporation
          (Chapter 1016 of the Laws 1969). It is similar to a municipal agency, but has a board of directors. It
          operates eleven acute care hospitals, five nursing homes, six diagnostic and treatment centers, and more than
          70 community-based primary care sites, serving primarily the poor and working class. HHC's own MetroPlus
          Health Plan is one of the New York area's largest providers of government-sponsored health insurance and is
          the plan of choice for nearly half a million New Yorkers.</p> <br>
        <p> The organization is headquartered at 125 Worth
          Street in Manhattan. Each year HHC's facilities provide about 225,000 inpatient admissions, one million
          emergency department visits and five million clinic visits to New Yorkers. HHC facilities treat nearly
          one-fifth of all general hospital discharges and more than one third of emergency department and
          hospital-based clinic visits in New York City. The most well known hospital in the HHC system is Bellevue
          Hospital â€“ the oldest public hospital in the United States. Bellevue is the designated hospital for treatment
          of the President of the United States and other world leaders if they become ill or injured while in New York
          City. The current president and CEO of NYC Health + Hospitals is Dr. Mitchell Katz. The organization underwent
          a rebranding initiative in November 2015, shortening its name from 40 characters to 19 characters, as "NYC
          Health + Hospitals". <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NYC_Health_%2B_Hospitals" target="_blank">(source
